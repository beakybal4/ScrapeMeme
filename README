Preamble:
So yeah, this is a little website scraper and viewer that I made, I did the PHP but the jQuery gallery is taken from here: http://brenelz.com/blog/build-a-content-slider-with-jquery/ 

Things that need doing:
	* parsing image URLs then scraping image from page
	* auto-load more stuffs when the user runs out
	* general spicing up
	* choose the site to pull from, rather than random choice?
